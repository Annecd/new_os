We use Basecamp for Ticket Repository.

## Conventions: 
1. link branch and tickets as possible
2. post the ticket url to commit comments. 
3. our Progress Managers ( who does only this task ) we negotiate the dues from you. please set it as possible 
4. It is important to Set due date on each tasks by clicking your name on the right side , calendar will display click the date when you can complete the task assignment.
5. Estimate the time of the given task, how many hours will you consume to complete each given task by writing a comment under your todos. this is also used to calculate the cost when you send invoice and get paid. 
6. If tasks completed, do not mark completed instead Use # string for tag to chaining the task - sometimes we use tags, to let workflow goes. like after developer completed the tasks it will have tag #to_be_tested or #releasing or as such. and tagging string should follow the form to start with #Create commit patch when you completed a todo. the most important rule is not to complete the task at your side. we need to test your work.
