# transription manual ver 2015

This manual gives a broad overview of transcribing procedures. It focuses on procedures, methods, and practical mechanisms that we will use to organize transcription files.

In this approach, transcribing DV’s or audio memo entails two main tasks: Transcription and Translation.  You will transcribe a minute of spoken audio memo or messages.  Translation of Japanese text, in this case make a TO DO in translation list and assign the task to translator.

Transcriptions are created by listening to the audio file and typing what you hear. Filler words, such as “uh,” “um,” and “ah” should not be included in the transcript. 

There are many usage of the transcribed texts and in some cases it's intended to relay message and instructions to the internal people, team members, developers, or administrators the other purpose is we are making a documentation content. The goal is to capture the main points of the voice memo and make necessary execution.


## 1. see the Voice Memo Inbox*1.

### 1.1.finding undone tasks
Audio voice memo is uploaded in Basecamp Project Inbox using audio recording from mobile device 
 Often you will receive  notification of new uploaded voice memo from global inbox (Please note: not all the time you will be notified in some cases because we are using mobile apps )
** There were 2 types of DV's uploaded. English and Japanese version **



## 2. Labeling ( tag ) Operaations on it
//@todo DV inserted here
status management for the transcriptions.

3-5 transcription status, labels, rules and it means that you should see
### status labels
#### the first one is “on transcriptions” tag  
label and it means you… that when you come to the work then you have to label if you find which you can do the transcription then you have to name it ah… when you start transcription you have to label it with “on transcription” and by this you can see which files are available for you and if it’s shows “on transcription” is locked to someone, someone is working on that already so it’s not for you and you can find other ones.   

#### 2.The second one for status label is the status label, is that done…d-o-n-e, done,  
  
it means it’s done, transcription is done and you have to label it after you complete the transcription on that. And this is the basic one.   

### the language labels, 
labels: English and Japanese.  
because you, I think, are English speakers and you guys are coming to the sites and if the transcription or voice memos are in Japanese, then you have to label it “Japanese” and if it’s English then label it “English.” I know yeah, you should. And it means that we have some Japanese transcriptors too and they come to the site and they try to find the ones they need to transcribe and then it’s done I mean simply they can find the Japanese ones only yeah. And also at their site they will name it “English,’ label it “English” like when it’s uploaded and they listen to it and it’s English so label it “English” so you can find the English version only by filtering, easier.   
  
### needs ( to be translation ) handling labels
labels:“to be transcribed” and “no transcription”
you need to label this one.they work as  couple.  
Sometime some of the transcriptions on head apart, over the voice memos, it tells “you don’t need”. or it’s says “you don’t need to transcribe”. 
And this one should be operated, handled by admins not transcriptors. And no need to transcribe and will be given to someone. 
Yeah usually they are tasks, assign to someone in BC, it’s kinda urgent ones, can’t wait to be transcribed then that’s marked so. So that’s the rules.
So basically you don’t need to transcribe to Japanese this and what you need to do is… to be transcribed no labels ones and English ones and not on transcriptions things, no “on transcription” things so that’s for you.
