## 2. Labeling ( tag ) Operaations on it
//@todo DV inserted here
status management for the transcriptions.

3-5 transcription status, labels, rules and it means that you should see
### status labels
#### the first one is “on transcriptions” tag  
label and it means you… that when you come to the work then you have to label if you find which you can do the transcription then you have to name it ah… when you start transcription you have to label it with “on transcription” and by this you can see which files are available for you and if it’s shows “on transcription” is locked to someone, someone is working on that already so it’s not for you and you can find other ones.   

#### 2.The second one for status label is the status label, is that done…d-o-n-e, done,  
  
it means it’s done, transcription is done and you have to label it after you complete the transcription on that. And this is the basic one.   

### the language levels, 
labels: English and Japanese.  
because you, I think, are English speakers and you guys are coming to the sites and if the transcription or voice memos are in Japanese, then you have to label it “Japanese” and if it’s English then label it “English.” I know yeah, you should. And it means that we have some Japanese transcriptors too and they come to the site and they try to find the ones they need to transcribe and then it’s done I mean simply they can find the Japanese ones only yeah. And also at their site they will name it “English,’ label it “English” like when it’s uploaded and they listen to it and it’s English so label it “English” so you can find the English version only by filtering, easier.   
  
### needs ( to be translation ) handling labels
labels:“to be transcribed” and “no transcription”
you need to label this one.they work as  couple.  
Sometime some of the transcriptions on head apart, over the voice memos, it tells “you don’t need”. or it’s says “you don’t need to transcribe”. 
And this one should be operated, handled by admins not transcriptors. And no need to transcribe and will be given to someone. 
Yeah usually they are tasks, assign to someone in BC, it’s kinda urgent ones, can’t wait to be transcribed then that’s marked so. So that’s the rules.
So basically you don’t need to transcribe to Japanese this and what you need to do is… to be transcribed no labels ones and English ones and not on transcriptions things, no “on transcription” things so that’s for you.

title the rough content summery, + original filename to the text.


Ok ahÖthis is a note for the transcription thing and…when you capture ìto doî for the transcripted content, please be careful you have a day must be completed list, transcribed inbox to the list is already there. Once you have completed a to-do list, or a list in the to-do list itís hidden, not displayed in the to-do list parts and itís in the completed to dos part you can find the completed to do list of transcribed inbox as indicated in the image below. And open the completed to dos and make another to-do there so there avoiding the duplicated name transcribed in the Inbox to the list could be made everytime you make the to-do list so this is the notes, additional notes about transcribed Inbox operations.
