We use Basecamp and flowddock chat systems.
Basecamp has its own commenting system, and it allows comments on tickets. then we can achieve to keep linked the comments and files to the todos. so we use input ( to execute the todo ) or comments, etc, there in the todo. 

We use Flowdock to do realtime chat. basecamp is semi-realtime, but sdomertimes we want to do realtime. but still “linking to the ticket” so very important to our workflow systems, we don’t use slack, chat works, hip chat or skype, and chose flow dock that enables us to link chat room and basecamp todo url. 

The Flowdock can be connected to basecamp the events and to do’s
you will find in flow inbox section, if you need real time conversation connection then we can easily use flow dock. 

The most important is we can keep the chat flow within the basecamp ticket events and to dos, these tickets will appear in flow dock inbox and from inbox items we can make conversations from there we can have real time communication.

Please follow these rules:
Please use  basecamp tickets  to connect flow dock conversation
Do not make new sub flow without linking to basecamp ticket
