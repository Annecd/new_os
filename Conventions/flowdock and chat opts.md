## Our Conventions 
### 1. Notifications
flow dock doen’t make notifications if you don’t mention. if the members you are talking to are not online and if you need him online realtime conversation, just mention. 

ex. @Anne - then your message  here

### 2. Try, never use, the 1-on-1 chat.
we know that people has tendency to hestiate opened chat, but better sharing the flow to be displayed with others. and follow the principle of mapping. 

### 3. use topic flow. 
use sub flow as topic. 

### 4. try use inbox items to make comments on an existing topics. 
dependency: ticket driven, link everything, permalink all principle. 

if what you are start talking about is already has the tickets in basecamp ( ticket repository ) then you should find the inbox item. 
all the basecamp activity is integrated into the flow dock inbox. and you can click and make comments on it. so you can make comments on it. by this you can find the all the history of comments, and people can see the context ( what to do list this is belonging to, what is the specs files uploaded in basecamp etc ) and can avoid duplication ( duplication is evil ) .

Follow the thread flow on each corresponding topics - this must be strictly observed.

### 5. Upload your image icon for identification. 
it makes team members recognition 70% fast. 

### 6. Do not send message without going into proper thread, this is against the procedures
