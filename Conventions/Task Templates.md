# Project Templates

- [ ] to be revised
 
we use project template for role base work. 
convention: if there is project template related to the task you are assigned, you should run the template  for sure. and do things there in the created project. it would be short term project. but we should make small projects and archive it small.

e.g. if you are an hiring manager and assigned a Todo to hire someone, then you must create a project from Project Template of Hiring ${Role} (for ${Project}) 

## the benefit of Project Template
1. we can follow the common and the best way of doing those typical tasks

this is the best way. for the most of project templates, have the consultants, and specialist for that tasks. 
e.g. in the “Hiring” template, it is design to have more and more people to post to many of hiring platforms, and also there is a todos to negotiate with trial tasks, this is following our company main product. newjit concept. to eliminate until we start hiring people, and can find good developer ( this is the one of the most important assets of us ) to repeat by having more people trial. this trial cost elimination makes more payments to good developers after the ones are  found. but if you don’t follow the rules to “making project from template if one exist” you will make demerits to the team about it. if you are an specialist of hiring, you are not allowed to skip creating project from templates. 
2. of course it omits our hands to make each of todos

the things below are still under revise. no need to read.

Furthermore, due to the fact that a list of completed tasks could be a source of task templates, we can stay on the “text-making” or “to-dos” that we have already been done. Write boards come in handy if we want to post information that needs to be edited. We can create a write board for our initial ideas and then come back and edit them later. Generally, we interact more with clients through To-Dos and Messages, but this may come in handy for our project as we make utilize of a template for our projects.

Using templates on projects are of a very helpful tool. We can repeat over and over so we don’t need to start on scratch each time. It allows us to make the necessary revisions or changes that we want to do for each and every piece of our content while establishing a wide and easy access on them each time we need them to. 

Here is an overview of what task template are, its functions, and more relevantly its great importance.

Thus, a task template is truly strength of a company.  Making a task template and capturing the “To Dos” in it is kind of investment with fruitful benefits, that each of us will have as we achieve our desired outcome for progress, because through it we already know what to do to keep going and finally finish the list.

As a kind of investment for instance, this integration template will aid to integrate people in a course. It was made actually from actual tasks once done and we are doing some maintenance on this task template. By doing this, if 100 people are integrating and if we don’t have this kind of template, then we must write up all the to-do tasks for us to avoid forgetting everything. 

A task template, this is what making companies better and better. So, we sometimes may ask you to make one.
Remember this instruction when you get this type of direction.
