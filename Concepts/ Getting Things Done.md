- [ ] needs to be revised.

Everything would be in one system and whenever we have the time to process the action associated with the file or  ubiquitous task capture, we wouldn’t have to look for it - it would be right there. This is an even more basic thing than adding actions, as after such a discussion-session the actions may arise later - now it’s all about not forgetting anything and having it all in one system.

Setting due dates and calendar events. Basecamp has this great feature of setting due-dates for actions and even defining how they should be repeated in time. This really helps us clear things off our head.

Same goes for repeating incomplete tasks.  Whenever comes, we see the list of actions we need to perform on our “next actions” list and  go with it. Basecamp has also reminder features so that you’d be reminded by email or notifications whenever the moment comes to do something.

Clear your head to keep your mind focused. Put the stuff into your trusted system like capturing tasks as Basecamp To Do’s and review it all later. 

 Adding priorities to projects or tasks feels like over-complicating the picture. we prefer just to re-organize projects with drag-and-drop  using the “hand” icon next to the project name. Higher-placed projects have higher priorities. In some case we add comments under the to do task such as urgent task . That’s it.

We can organize everything by using adding to do list in Basecamp, review all task assignment . We will be able to easily keep our mind focused and organized , prioritized tasks by simple reordering.

Using this concept will guide us to Identify our Next Action plan- if we don’t know what to do with a project - think what’s the next small physical we have to make to move it forward. Don’t overdo with Next Actions or you’ll lose focus. We should learn to master our Next Actions list - it’s our key to productivity.

Basecamp To-do and tasks lists are great for putting things you have to do. GTD helps us organize these lists and indeed - get things done. The “Contexts” concept is another weapon to help us clear these lists and get more tasks done.  it can be a place, a tool or an environment…. which can be applied to to-dos in different projects. Some examples for contexts: basecamp to do’s , email, evernote,voice memo, video presentation Right then when you add an action, you can quickly choose a context.

Be Productive Everywhere – On the Move, Online, Offline

This is one factor we encourage our people to be productive everywhere. In our case we sometimes have urgent task that need to be completed but we we’re not able to reach or contact respective people for some reason that they are offline or on the move. This case we lose opportunities to be productive because they’re not equipped to take advantage of the odd moments and windows of time that open up as they move from one place to another, or when they’re in off-site environments. The combination of a good processing style, the right tools, and good interconnected systems at home and at work can make traveling a highly leveraged way to get certain kinds of work done.” Computer is not the only productivity tool you’ve got. With help of pen and paper, or mobile phone, you can be productive just anywhere. simply access on your mobile device.

Share Projects and Delegate Tasks - Synergize

If the next action is going to take longer than two minutes, ask yourself, “Am I the best person to be doing it?” If not, hand it off to the appropriate party, in a systematic format. Delegation is not always downstream.
